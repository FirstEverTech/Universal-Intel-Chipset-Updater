## PROFESSIONAL PROFILE

IT Architect and Strategic Consultant with a proven ability to independently deliver global-scale solutions that address long-standing industry problems. I combine 8+ years of experience in IT strategy and business relationship management within multinational corporations (Sitel, SYKES) with deep technical expertise and the effective use of AI.

I am the creator of the **Universal Intel Chipset Device Updater** – an open-source project that, within three months of its release, achieved over **18,000 downloads** and **~300 daily visits** on GitHub. The project solves a 25-year-old issue with Intel's chipset INF management, a problem that official Intel tools have never properly addressed. This initiative serves as tangible proof of my ability to architect, code, test, and manage a complex project from concept to community adoption, replacing the work of an entire cross-functional team.

I am seeking a role where I can leverage this unique blend of strategic vision and hands-on technical execution to drive meaningful innovation.

## FLAGSHIP PROJECT: Universal Intel Chipset Device Updater

**Creator, Lead Architect & Developer** | [github.com/FirstEverTech/Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater](https://github.com/FirstEverTech/Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater)

Took on the challenge of solving a decades-old problem: the lack of transparency and effectiveness in Intel's official chipset update utility. The result is a standalone tool that genuinely detects outdated hardware and installs the correct INF files, providing users with clear feedback.

**Project Scope & Technical Execution:**

- **Designed and built the `Intel Platform Scanner`:** A custom tool that parses over 5,300 INF files, creating a database of more than **102,000 HWID-to-platform relationships**. This scanner is the core engine for generating the project's live data.
- **Engineered the `Universal Intel Chipset Updater`:** A robust PowerShell script that:
    - Detects Intel hardware on the user's system via PNP devices.
    - Queries the dynamically generated database to identify the correct and latest INF package.
    - Downloads installers from official Intel sources, with **SHA256 hash verification** and **automatic failover to backup mirrors** to ensure integrity and reliability.
    - Implements a multi-screen UI with system restore point creation and comprehensive logging.
- **Developed a custom data pipeline:** Created a parser for a Markdown-based hardware database and a custom `.txt` download manifest, enabling the tool to be updated independently of new Intel releases.
- **Performed the role of a full team:** Acted as Product Owner, Architect, Developer, QA Tester, and Community Manager. The code and architecture have been audited by 6 major AI models, achieving an **average score of 9.4/10**, with all models confirming the project's scope and quality typically requires a team of 6-7 specialists.

**Key Outcomes & Impact:**

- **Adoption:** Gained over **18,000 downloads** in the first three months post-launch.
- **Reach:** Maintains a steady traffic of **~300 unique visitors per day** to the project page.
- **Community Validation:** Became a trusted alternative for advanced users and IT administrators, receiving positive feedback for solving a problem long ignored by official channels.
- **Proof of Competence:** The project itself serves as a live portfolio, demonstrating advanced skills in PowerShell, data parsing, API integration, security implementation, and open-source project management.
